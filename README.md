# A Module for proxying discord webhooks!
___

# Features
#### Managed Requests!
> Using the rate-limit information Hyra provides, Requests that are being rate-limited are stored until the rate-limit window has reset. in other words : if your request is valid, it wonâ€™t get dropped.

#### Simple Usage!
> A Discord webhook should be structured similar to this :
> `https://discord.com/api/webhooks/ID/TOKEN`
> and using Proxhook is just a matter of plugging in the ID, TOKEN, & the data you want to send.
```lua
local Proxhook = require(script.Proxhook);

local Success = Proxhook(ID, TOKEN, DATA); -- <@Success> : boolean
```
